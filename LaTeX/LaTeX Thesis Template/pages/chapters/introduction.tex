\section{Introduction}
We chose to optimize the program "LetterFrequencies" that were provided to us by the school. The program opens text file, counts all of the occurring letters in the file and then prints the result.\\\\
Our assignment were to optimize the programs performance with at least 50\%, which we achieved by replacing the programs "reader" with a "bufferedReader".
