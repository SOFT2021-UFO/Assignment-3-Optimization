\section{Math equations}

\subsection{Inline equations (in text)}
Have you ever heard of Pythagorean theorem: \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) ? It's pretty neat.

\subsection{Display equations (n separate lines)}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated by the equation:
\begin{center}
    $E=mc^2$
\end{center}
Albert Einstein discovered it in 1905!

\subsection{Fractions, summations, products, roots, powers}
    \textbf{Fractions}\\
        This is 0.5 presented as a fraction: \( \frac{1}{2} \). Neat right?\\

    \textbf{Summation can be inserted as shown on Eqn. \ref{eq:sum}}\\
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{x=1}^{n}x^2=1
            \label{eq:sum}
        \end{equation}

    \textbf{Product sequence can be inserted as shown in Eqn. \ref{eq:prod}}\\
        \begin{equation}
            \prod_{x=1}^{n}x^2
            \label{eq:prod}
        \end{equation}

    \textbf{Square Root}\\
        The square root of 100 is \(\sqrt{100}=10\).

    \textbf{Power}\\
        Two to the power of five is \(2^5 = 32 \).
