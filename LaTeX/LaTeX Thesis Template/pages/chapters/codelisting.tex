The below code from my Text Simlarity assignment in the Data Science class \parencite{dsc-text-similarity}.\\

# # Vectorisation of Text Data
# The process of converting or transforming a data set into a set of Vectors is called Vectorization.

# Calculate dot product of two vectors, divide it by the magnitudes to find the cos(angle between them)
# Use the result as a correlation coefficient
